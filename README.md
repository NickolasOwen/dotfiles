The primary configs here are for neovim and wezterm as these are the two tools
I use to develop across windows and linux. I use PowerShell Core as my primary
shell as I find it the easiest to use cross platform and be consistent.

My powershell profile is also available in this repository containing custom
functions and alias that I use.
